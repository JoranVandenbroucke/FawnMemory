# FawnMemory

This repository was a learning experience on how allocators and memory managers work.
The first allocators were inspired by CppCon (2015).
In this talk, Andrei Alexandrescu started by showing a simple FallbackAllocator, StackAllocator, Mallocator and more.
Implementing these allocators gave a better insight into how memory can be stored.
